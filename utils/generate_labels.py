Score the following text from a conversation of an intermediate English language (B1-B2 on CEFR) student that is supposed to have 
the following lexical and grammatical competence:

-Has a good range of vocabulary for matters connected to their field and most general topics.
-Can produce appropriate collocations of many words/signs in most contexts fairly systematically.
-Good grammatical control; occasional slips or non-systematic errors and minor flaws in sentence structure may still occur.
-Does not make mistakes which lead to misunderstanding.
-Has a good command of simple language structures and some complex grammatical forms.

Provide only the measures in the 'ScoringTexts' function.
